<p>对象被放置并添加了纹理/颜色，且完成了轻微反射的地面之后，你不需要成为一名火箭科学家来照亮场景。</p>
<p>在这个场景中，除<a href="5798.html" target="">物理天空</a>外的光源只有左侧的两个辉光灯。</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:1199px"><img  src="../pics/020171.jpg"  ><span class="caption">The Physical Sky and 2 Polygon Lights are used to light the scene.</span></div></p>
<p>The front and rear of the room have openings that let a large amount of light in. Two types of light enter the room through these openings, both of which come from the Physical Sky:<ul></p>
<p><li> The yellow sunlight that casts an Area shadow</li><li> The bluish sky light that is emitted by a sky hemisphere.</li>The two Polygon Lights (objects with a luminous material applied) on the wall at the left influence the overall lighting of the room very little. The nominal amount of light emitted by the television at the right plays no role at all. </p>
<p></ul><p></p>
<p>These few light sources are enough to achieve a realistic lighting of this scene. The bulk of the work is done by GI. Otherwise the <span class="command">Preset</span> <span class="command_value">Interior High (High Diffuse Depth)</span> will be used.</p>
<p>A Physical Sky was used with a slightly raised <a href="OSKYSHADER-ID_SKY_GROUP_PHYSICAL_SKY.html#SKY_REAL_SKY_SKY_INTENSITY" target="">Sky</a> value and a much stronger <a href="OSKYSHADER-ID_SKY_GROUP_PHYSICAL_SUN.html#SKY_REAL_SKY_SUN_INTENSITY" target="">Sun</a> value applied.</p>

<p>What sets this scene off, in addition to the dispersed reflection of the floor tiles and the displacement-generated area rug, is the HDRI lighting that was used.</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:640px"><img  src="../pics/020173.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Light only enters this room through the window and the skylight!</span></div></p>
<p>This room has two relatively large openings through which light can enter - the skylight in the ceiling and the window. Both openings were defined as <a href="32221.html" target="">GI Portals</a> in order to concentrate the GI calculations in the right areas. The light is generated via a <a href="11801.html" target="">HDRI</a> texture on the <a href="OSKY.html" target="">Sky Object</a>. </p>

<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:1000px"><img  src="../pics/020174.jpg"  ><span class="caption">4 Area lights are used to illuminate the Vase.</span></div></p>
<p>What is it that makes this vase look so darn good? Actually, nothing special (except for the excellent composition of the scene itself … ): The scene is lit by four slightly blue and orange colored <a href="OLIGHT-LIGHT_GROUP_GENERAL.html#LIGHT_TYPE" target="">Area</a> lights with Inverse Square falloff ("Details" tab). The falloff type is important since it most accurately simulates the falloff of real world light. Additionally, the <a href="OLIGHT-LIGHT_GROUP_DETAILS.html#LIGHT_AREADETAILS_SHOWINREFLECTION" target="">Show in Reflection</a> option has been activated for several of the Area lights, resulting in several reflections on the surface of the vase.</p>
<p>As you can see in the image above, the use of GI (<span class="command">IR+IR</span> <span class="command">Diffuse Depth</span> = 3) results in an even and very pleasant dispersion of light.</p>
<p><a id="hl_5" name="hl_5"></a><!--INDEX "3","Outdoor Scenes","hl_5"--><p><span class="HL_1">Outdoor Scenes</span></p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:981px"><img  src="../pics/020176.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Left: <span class="command">Diffuse Depth</span> = <span class="command_value">1</span>; right: Diffuse Depth = 3. The visible difference is minimal but the difference in render times is large.</span></div></p>
<p>For outdoor scenes that are illuminated primarily by the sky a <span class="command">Diffuse Depth</span> value of <span class="command_value">1</span> is sufficient since the sky emits light from just about every direction and almost all object surfaces "see" the sky and are illuminated by its light.</p>
<p><a id="32BIT" name="32BIT"></a></p>
<p><a id="hl_6" name="hl_6"></a><!--INDEX "3","Color Mapping and 32-bit Rendering","hl_6"--><p><span class="HL_1">Color Mapping and 32-bit Rendering</span></p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:1200px"><img  src="../pics/020177.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Left a normal 8-bit rendering; at right the image rendered with Color Mapping. The only light source used was a Polygon Light (object with illuminating material applied). Scene by Holger Schömann.</span></div></p>
<p>Balancing the brightness of a rendered image is very important for achieving optimal render results. Many times the brightness of a scene is inhomogeneous or contains faulty contrasts. Sometimes artists tend to pump up the brightness of the light sources if a scene is rendered too dark only to realize that these areas are then too brightly illuminated.</p>
<p>There are two ways in which this can be avoided:<ul></p>
<p><li> <a href="VPCOLORMAPPING-ID_VIDEOPOSTPROPERTIES.html" target="">Color Mapping</a></li><li> <a href="DRENDERSETTINGS-RDATA_GROUP_SAVE.html#RDATA_FORMATDEPTH" target="">32-bit</a> rendering with subsequent editing in an image editing software that can edit 32-bit images and offers the necessary tools for editing 32-bit color depth (the current version of Photoshop offers only a limited number of tools for working with 32-bit images).</li></ul><p></p>
<p>Both methods basically do the same thing - they take rendered images with greater color depths and converts them to 8-bit images.</p>

<p><a id="hl_7" name="hl_7"></a><!--INDEX "3","Exclude Glass from GI","hl_7"--><p><span class="HL_1">Exclude Glass from GI</span></p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:751px"><img  src="../pics/020179.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Each of the transparent objects was excluded from GI in a different manner. Render times increased from left to right. Not how dark the shadows were rendered in the middle image.</span></div></p>
<p>Depending on the scene you exclude an object from GI by<ul></p>
<p><li> applying a Compositing tag (<a href="TCOMPOSITING-ID_TAGPROPERTIES.html#COMPOSITINGTAG_SEENBYGI" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Seen by GI</span></a> option) … </li><li> or in the material channel (<a href="MMATERIAL-ID_MATERIALGROUP_ILLUMINATION.html#gi" target="">Receive GI</a> option or <span class="command">Generate GI</span> for Caustics), which lets you "block" GI for certain materials (this occurs automatically for transparent materials with <span class="command">Receive GI</span> - see also <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_OPTIONS.html#GI_SETUP_DATA_EXTRA_NON_DIFFUSE_CUTOFF" target="">Glass/Mirror Optimization</a>).</li></ul><p></p>
<p>Due to its transparency, glass can easily be excluded from GI since the effect is so minimal and the render times can thereby be reduced.</p>
<p>You basically have to decide on an individual basis whether or not applying GI to a glass object in your scene will make a noticeable or important difference in the final rendered image. Use the image above as a reference.</p>
<p><a id="hl_8" name="hl_8"></a><!--INDEX "3","GI and Baking Textures","hl_8"--><p><span class="HL_1">GI and Baking Textures</span></p>

<p><a id="hl_9" name="hl_9"></a><!--INDEX "3","GI and Specular Highlights","hl_9"--><p><span class="HL_1">GI and Specular Highlights</span></p>
<p>Note that the material’s Specular Color channel will be ignored when only GI is used to illuminate a scene (without using Cinema 4D light objects and only using luminous objects). So, why is this?</p>
<p>Well, both effects are simply well-functioning illusions to make materials look realistic using common, often spherically shaped (i.e. very small) sources of light. In the real world, specular highlights are merely a reflection of area light.</p>
<p>For the calculation of GI this means the following: Specular highlights are adjusted using the Reflectance channel and the size/color of the luminous object.</p>
<p>Of course you can also create additional Cinema 4D light sources that affect specific objects in order to create more specular highlights. This may not be in harmony with the principle of a true global illumination but what counts is the final result!</p>

<p><a id="hl_10" name="hl_10"></a><!--INDEX "3","GI and Animation","hl_10"--><p><span class="HL_1">GI and Animation</span></p>
<p>GI and animations are technically challenging. If a single image takes a long time to render using GI, then rendering an animation with a series of these images will require very long render times. In addition, Irradiance Cache tends to flicker if its settings are set too low.</p>
<p>You should adhere to the following when creating animations with GI:<ul></p>
<p><li> When using IR+IR/IR+QMC: if flickering occurs on surfaces, the <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_GENERAL.html#GI_SETUP_DATA_QMC_COUNT_METHOD" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Samples</span></a> value probably too low (four-digit figures may even be required). If, on the other hand, flickering occurs in small regions around an object, the <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_IC2.html#GI_SETUP_DATA_IC2_QUALITY" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Record Density</span></a> value is too low. In this case, decreasing the <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_IC2.html#GI_SETUP_DATA_IC2_MAX_LIMIT" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Maximum Spacing</span></a> value should help. If this does not do the trick, set the <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_IC2.html#GI_SETUP_DATA_IC2_QUALITY" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Record Density</span></a> to a higher setting.</li><li> Flickering can even occur at optimized IR+LM settings if the base light map is of poor quality (see ,Optimize Light Mapping’ below).</li><li> QMC+QMC will not flicker (the render times will increase accordingly; these will be at a maximum).</li></ul><p></p>
<p><a id="CAMAN" name="CAMAN"></a></p>
<p><a id="hl_11" name="hl_11"></a><!--INDEX "3","Camera Animation and Full Animation","hl_11"--><p><span class="HL_2">Camera Animation and Full Animation</span></p>
<p>Irradiance Cache offers the following animation types:<ul></p>
<p><li> <span class="command">Use Camera Path</span>: Only the camera is in motion and all other Project elements remain unchanged with regard to lighting - no objects and no lights move. This makes it easy for Irradiance Cache because it can use a single, non-flickering cache for the entire animation. The <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_CACHES.html#GI_SETUP_DATA_CACHE_ANIMATION" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Full Animation Mode</span></a> must be disabled (and <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_LIGHT_MAPPING.html#GI_SETUP_DATA_LIGHT_MAPPING_PATH_CAMERA" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Use Camera Path</span></a> enabled if light maps are used). You can also use tricks (see <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_CACHES.html#GI_SETUP_DATA_CACHE_PREPASS" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Prepass Only</span></a>) to get the desired result.</li></ul><p></p>
<p><p><div class="hint"><span class="HL_hint">Tip:<br></span>Note that when rendering via Team Render, working with a cache is only effective if a single cache (that can only be generated without Team Render on a single computer)  is available for distribution prior to rendering. This cache can then be distributed to the render clients (<a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_CACHES.html#GI_SETUP_DATA_CACHE_AUTOLOAD" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Auto Load</span></a> option enabled).</div></p>
<p><ul></p>
<p><li> <span class="command">Full Animation</span>: For a different lighting situation in which objects and/or lights are animated, a separate cache must be rendered for each image. If you do not want to load or save GI cache files, disable <span class="command">Auto Save</span> and <span class="command">Auto Load</span> (<span class="command">Cache Files</span> tab) for all cache types involved. Deactivate all options pertaining to camera animations (such as <span class="command">Use Camera Path</span> for light mapping). </li></ul><p></p>
<p>If you want to load/save cache files, <span class="command">Auto Load</span>, <span class="command">Auto Save</span> and <span class="command">Full Animation Mode</span> must be enabled for all cache types involved.</p>

<p><a id="hl_13" name="hl_13"></a><!--INDEX "3","Stills","hl_13"--><p><span class="HL_3">Stills</span></p>
<p>With still you don’t have to make any changes; using the default render settings (not the <a href="DRENDERSETTINGS-RDATA_GROUP_NET.html" target="">Render Settings</a> in conjunction with this), all Render Clients will participate in rendering a single cache file, which will also be used by all Render Clients during rendering.</p>
<p><a id="hl_14" name="hl_14"></a><!--INDEX "3","Animation","hl_14"--><p><span class="HL_3">Animation</span></p>
<p>First you must ascertain if a Camera Aniamtion or a Full Animation is being rendered (see above for an explanation of how these differ).<ul></p>
<p><li> <span class="command">Full Animation</span>: This can be sent directly to Team Render for rendering. Make sure that the <span class="command">Full Animation</span> option is enabled in the <span class="command">Cache Files</span> tab.</li><li> <span class="command">Camera Animation</span>: All caches must first be pre-calculated without Team Render (this is the only way to achieve flicker-free results). Subsequently, the scene can be rendered in Team Render, including cache files.</li></ul><p></p>
<p>The following applies to both methods: If pre-calculated cache files exist that should be used with Team Render, the <span class="command">Auto Load</span> option must be enabled in the <span class="command">Cache Files</span> tab.</p>
<p>If QMC Rendering is being used, which does not require caches, it can also be sent directly to Team Render.</p>

<p><a id="hl_15" name="hl_15"></a><!--INDEX "3","Optimizing Light Mapping","hl_15"--><p><span class="HL_2">Optimizing Light Mapping</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, light maps are not particularly constant from one animation frame to the next. In addition, light leaks can suddenly occur, which negatively effect the GI calculation. Try the following:<ul></p>
<p><li> Experiment with <span class="command">Prefilter</span> (faster) and <span class="command">Interpolation Method</span> (slower) in the <span class="command">Light Mapping</span> tab. Light maps can be smoothed to a certain degree, which reduces the differences between subsequent light maps. Larger <span class="command">Sample Count</span> values are also helpful because they also have a smoothing effect.</li><li> Single-polygonal wall strengths can lead to light leaks (small, very bright spots). Make sure walls are created with the proper volume (i.e., thickness).</li><li> If widespread flickering occurs at corners/bevels when using IR+LM, increase the <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_LIGHT_MAPPING.html#GI_SETUP_DATA_LIGHT_MAPPING_PATH_COUNT" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Path Count (x1000)</span></a> value. If flickering only occurs in a small, isolated region, reducing the <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_LIGHT_MAPPING.html#GI_SETUP_DATA_LIGHT_MAPPING_PATH_SCALE_SCREEN" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Samples Size</span></a> value can help (the <span class="command">Path Count (1000s)</span> value might have to be increased to compensate).</li></ul><p></p>
