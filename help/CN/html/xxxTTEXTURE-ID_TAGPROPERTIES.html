<p>Flat projection tends to be used with flat objects only. The texture is soon distorted when applied to a sphere or cylinder, as the examples demonstrate.</p>
<p><a id="TEXTURETAG_PROJECTION_CUBIC" name="TEXTURETAG_PROJECTION_CUBIC"></a><!--INDEX "10","Cubic","TEXTURETAG_PROJECTION_CUBIC"--><span class="c4d_id_cycle">Cubic</span></p>
<p><span class="command_value">Cubic</span> mapping projects the texture onto all six sides of a texture cube.</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:370px"><img  src="../pics/004553.jpg"  ><span class="caption"></span></div></p>

<p>The texture is projected from the camera position onto the object. This ensures that, it you project the texture onto a <span class="command">Polygon</span> object and onto a <span class="command">Background</span> object, the two textures match exactly (assuming the Texture tags for both objects use the same Offset and Length values).</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:460px"><img  src="../pics/004555.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Frontal applied to a cuboid.</span></div></p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:460px"><img  src="../pics/004556.jpg"  ><span class="caption"></span></div></p>
<p>You can create various visual effects using Frontal mapping, or perform compositing tricks directly in Cinema 4D.</p>
<p>You have probably seen science fiction films where characters or spaceships gradually blend into the background using <span class="command">cloaking</span>. Use <span class="command_value">Frontal</span> mapping for such effects. For another interesting effect, remove the Background object and move the polygon around!</p>
<p><a id="TEXTURETAG_PROJECTION_SPATIAL" name="TEXTURETAG_PROJECTION_SPATIAL"></a><!--INDEX "10","Spatial","TEXTURETAG_PROJECTION_SPATIAL"--><span class="c4d_id_cycle">Spatial</span></p>
<p>Spatial mapping is similar to Flat projection. However, with Spatial mapping, the texture is pulled up and to the left as it passes through the object.</p>
<table  border="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="0">  <TR>    <TD><div class="image_full" style="max-width:370px"><img  src="../pics/004559.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Flat</span></div></TD>    <TD><div class="image_full" style="max-width:370px"><img  src="../pics/004560.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Spatial</span></div></TD>  </TR></TABLE>
<p>Spatial mapping does, however, cause some distortion and as such it is not suitable for photographic images. Spatial mapping is more suitable for structural textures, such as plaster and marble.</p>
<p><a id="UVW" name="UVW"></a></p>
<p><a id="TEXTURETAG_PROJECTION_UVW" name="TEXTURETAG_PROJECTION_UVW"></a><!--INDEX "10","UVW Mapping","TEXTURETAG_PROJECTION_UVW"--><span class="c4d_id_cycle">UVW Mapping</span></p>
<p>If an object has UVW coordinates, you can select them as the projection type. In this case, the texture geometry is fixed to the object surface and is subject to all subsequent movement and deformation applied to the object. UV projection is explained <a href="6375.html" target="">in the <nobr><span class="menu">UV Edit</span></nobr> menu</a>.</p>
<p>An example of UVW mapping is the page of a book as it is being turned. First you must fix the texture (e.g., ornate text and a pretty picture) to the page using UVW mapping. Next, animate the turn of the page with a deformation. The texture bends with the page.</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:600px"><img  src="../pics/004561.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Flat Mapping (left) and UVW Mapping (right).</span></div></p>
<p>All of Cinema 4D’s primitive objects and Generator objects have UVW coordinates. If you apply a new texture to these objects, the projection type in the Texture tag will default to UVW mapping.</p>
<p>All Polygon objects with UVW coordinates have a UVW tag in the <span class="command">Object Manager</span>.</p>
<p><img class="cmd_icon" src="../icons/TUVW.png" alt=""   height="24" width="24"    border="1"> </p>
<p>Primitive objects and Generator objects have internal UVW coordinates and do not have a UVW tag in the <span class="command">Object Manager</span>. You can still use UVW mapping with these objects. If you convert a Primitive object or Generators to a Polygon object, a UVW tag will appear in the <span class="command">Object Manager</span>.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why there are three coordinates (UVW).</p>
<p><a id="hl_1" name="hl_1"></a><!--INDEX "3","What’s the third coordinate for?","hl_1"--><p><span class="HL_2">What’s the third coordinate for?</span></p>
<p>Conventional textures have two coordinates, one for the horizontal position (X) and one for the vertical position (Y). In order to make it clear that the coordinates refer to a texture, X is renamed U and Y is renamed V. Two coordinates (U and V) would be sufficient were it not for 3D <a href="5812.html" target="">shaders</a>. These are three dimensional textures and as such they require a third coordinate (W) in order to be fixed to the object.</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:600px"><img  src="../pics/004563.jpg"  ><span class="caption"></span></div></p>
<p><a id="hl_2" name="hl_2"></a><!--INDEX "3","More than one UVW texture geometry","hl_2"--><p><span class="HL_2">More than one UVW texture geometry</span></p>
<p>You can apply more than one UVW texture geometry to an object. Create a new Texture tag for the object, then set the projection you require, such as Flat mapping for a label texture. Next, create new UVW coordinates for the active texture by choosing <span class="command">Generate UVW Coordinates</span> from the <span class="command">Object Manager’s</span> Texture menu. The selected Texture tag will be set to UVW mapping and will then deform together with the object.</p>
<p>A new UVW tag is added to the existing ones each time you call <span class="command">Generate UVW Coordinates</span>. A Texture tag (UVW mapping selected) always uses the UVW map directly to its right in the <span class="command">Object Manager</span>. This allows you to assign different UVW maps to different Texture tags. If there is no UVW tag to the right of the Texture tag, then the first UVW tag will be used.</p>
<p><a id="hl_3" name="hl_3"></a><!--INDEX "3","The structure of UVW coordinates","hl_3"--><p><span class="HL_2">The structure of UVW coordinates</span></p>
<p>What is the structure of UVW coordinates? Imagine a grid divided into a U direction and a V direction (see Figure 1, below). </p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:640px"><img  src="../pics/004564.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Figure 1.</span></div></p>
<p>The UV range starts at <span class="command_value">0, 0</span> and ends at <span class="command_value">1, 1</span>. For an upright polygon, <span class="command_value">0, 0</span> describes the top left; <span class="command_value">0, 1</span> the top left; <span class="command_value">1, 0</span> the top right and <span class="command_value">1, 1</span> the top right. A texture is stretched out between these four coordinates (Figure 2).</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:640px"><img  src="../pics/004565.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Figure 2.</span></div></p>
<p>But where is the W coordinate in this system? Recall that conventional textures are two-dimensional — the W coordinate is created only when needed. Once created, the W coordinate behaves in the same way as the UV coordinates.</p>
<p><a id="hl_4" name="hl_4"></a><!--INDEX "3","Selective UVW Mapping","hl_4"--><p><span class="HL_2">Selective UVW Mapping</span></p>
<p>Cinema 4D has two ways of allocating texture projections to polygon selections (rather than to the whole object as described above). The first method is described below. See above for details on the second method.</p>
<p>Selective UVW mapping allows you to apply a different projection type to several regions of the object using the same texture geometry.</p>
<p><a id="hl_5" name="hl_5"></a><!--INDEX "3","Proceed as follows:","hl_5"--><p><span class="HL_3">Proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p><ol><br><li> Create a sphere and convert it into a polygon object using <span class="command">Make Editable</span>.<br><li> Create a new material with a texture, e.g., the checkerboard shader, and set the projection to <span class="command">Flat</span>.<br><li> Select the <span class="command">Polygons tool</span> and select several polygons in various locations.<br><li> In the <span class="command">Object Manager’s</span> <span class="command">Tag</span> menu, select the <span class="command">Assign UVW Coordinates</span> command.<br></ol><p></p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:588px"><img  src="../pics/004566.jpg"  ><span class="caption"></span></div></p>
<p>The selected polygons use Flat projection while the unselected polygons continue to use the normal UVW mapping. If you deform the object, the texture remains fixed in the selected region.</p>
<p><a id="TEXTURETAG_PROJECTION_SHRINKWRAP" name="TEXTURETAG_PROJECTION_SHRINKWRAP"></a><!--INDEX "10","Shrink Wrapping","TEXTURETAG_PROJECTION_SHRINKWRAP"--><span class="c4d_id_cycle">Shrink Wrapping</span></p>
<p>With this projection type, the center of the texture is fixed to the north pole of a sphere and the rest of the texture is stretched over it. The advantage of this mapping type is that the texture meets itself at the south pole only. This avoids a seam running between the poles. Only a circular section of the texture is used, with the center of the circle corresponding to the center of the picture. The remainder of the picture is discarded.</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:640px"><img  src="../pics/004567.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Shrink Wrapping.</span></div></p>
<p><a id="TEXTURETAG_PROJECTION_CAMERAMAP" name="TEXTURETAG_PROJECTION_CAMERAMAP"></a><!--INDEX "10","Camera Mapping","TEXTURETAG_PROJECTION_CAMERAMAP"--><span class="c4d_id_cycle">Camera Mapping</span></p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:800px"><img  src="../pics/004557.jpg"  ><span class="caption"></span></div> </p>
<p>With camera mapping, the texture is projected from the camera onto the object.</p>
<p><p><div class="hint"><span class="HL_hint">Tip:<br></span>Camera mapping has its own Manager, <a href="32201.html" target="">Projection Man</a>, which offers all the options you will need for Camera Mapping. This Manager also offers a lot of automation and lessens the number of adjustments you have to conduct manually such as creating the camera, assigning cameras to Texture tags, etc.</div></p>
<p>Suppose you want to use a photo and have it interact with your models. For example, perhaps you want a 3D figure to walk behind some of the objects in the photo! Camera mapping can help you to pull off these kinds of tricks.</p>
<p>First, load the photo into the Color channel of a new material. Apply the material to the object with camera mapping. For this, you will need a camera for projecting the material onto the object. Switch on this camera for the viewport (viewport: Cameras / Use Camera / Camera XXX).</p>
<p>Now reconstruct (model) any objects in the real picture that the figure (or other objects) will need to pass behind.</p>
<p>For example, if you want a 3D figure to walk behind a crate in the photo, build the crate in 3D (it can be very simple — it is just a screen for the crate texture). Next, project the background texture onto the reconstructed objects (e.g., the crate) using camera mapping. Now your figure can walk behind the crate!.</p>
<p><p><div class="hint"><span class="HL_hint"></span>Keep the limitations of camera mapping in mind. For example, you cannot rotate a full <span class="command_value">360°</span> around a building. The photo is usually already distorted by perspective so, at certain angles, you will get a distortion of a distortion and poor texture quality.</div></p>
<p><a id="TEXTURETAG_SIDE" name="TEXTURETAG_SIDE"></a> <!--INDEX "8","Side","TEXTURETAG_SIDE"--><span class="c4d_id">Side</span></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Suppose you project a texture onto a tube with Flat mapping. If you move the camera around to look at the other side of the surface, you will still see the texture, but it will be the wrong way round. You can solve this problem by using a decal — a material that is projected on one side of the surface only.</p>
<p>The direction of the surface Normals for each polygon plays a pivotal role in deciding on which side the texture is mapped. <span class="command">Front</span> is in the direction of the surface Normals and <span class="command">Back</span> means in the opposite direction to the surface Normals (see Figure 1).</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:444px"><img  src="../pics/004569.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Figure 1.</span></div></p>
<p>With <span class="command">Flat projection</span>, a texture is projected from the front through to the back of an object. As a result, the texture is also visible where it is not wanted — in this case, on the front as well as on the back of the tube (Figure 2).</p>
<table  border="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="0">  <TR>    <TD><div class="image_full" style="max-width:476px"><img  src="../pics/004570.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Figure 2.</span></div> </td></p>
<p>    <TD><div class="image_full" style="max-width:476px"><img  src="../pics/004571.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Figure 3.</span></div></td></p>
<p>  </TR></TABLE>
<p>You can avoid such problems with decal mapping. Change Side from Both to Front. Now render the tube again. This time the label is visible on the front side only (Figure 3). If the viewing angle (i.e. the camera angle) and the surface normal form an angle of less than 90° to each other, the polygon is a front polygon. Otherwise, it is a back polygon (Figure 4).</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:640px"><img  src="../pics/004572.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Figure 4.</span></div></p>
<p>The only exceptions are for Flat and Spatial mapping. Here there is an additional criterion: the direction of the texture projection’s Z axis. If the texture’s Z axis points in the opposite direction to the surface normal and if the viewing angle and surface normal form an angle of less than <span class="command_value">90°</span> to each other, the polygon is a front polygon; otherwise, it is a back polygon.</p>

<p>The Tiles values are the number of times the texture fits onto the texture envelope in the U and V directions (Length U and Length V).</p>
<p>Isn’t that the same as changing the length?</p>
<p>Exactly. You can change the length either in terms of tiles (<span class="command">Tiles U</span>, <span class="command">Tiles V</span>) or as a percentage of the texture envelope (<span class="command">Length U</span>, <span class="command">Length V</span>). Either way, changing one will cause the other to change. Note that the texture will only be repeated (tiled) if the Tile option is enabled.</p>
<p>Cinema 4D calculates the size of an individual tile from the current texture size. For example, if you have scaled the texture so that it has a length of <span class="command_value">25%</span> in the U direction and 50% in the V direction, the texture fits four times in the U direction (1, 0.25) and twice in the V direction (1, 0.5) on the surface. If you change the Tile U or Tile V settings, the Length settings change automatically. For example, if you change the number to <span class="command_value">3</span>, the texture shrinks from <span class="command_value">50%</span> to <span class="command_value">33.33%</span>.</p>

<p>If you define the tile size via the <span class="command">Tiles U/V</span> values you can use the <span class="command">Repetition</span> values to define how often tiling should repeat in all directions.

<p>If this option is enabled, the texture picture will be repeated endlessly on the surface.</p>
<p>The effect becomes visible when you scale down the <a href="5495.html" target="">texture</a> or when the texture geometry has not yet been fitted to the object using the <a href="5748.html#aufobjektanpassen" target="">Fit To Object</a> command.

<p>Prior to Cinema 4D R8.2, the bump was always projected using spherical mapping — even if UVW mapping was defined. Since R8.2, UVW mapping has been used instead provided the Texture tag has UVW Mapping selected. This can lead to problems — see the following picture.</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:598px"><img  src="../pics/004581.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Artifacts with the Noise shader in the Bump shader and Use UVW For Bump enabled.</span></div></p>
<p>Artifacts may appear in certain areas in the border area between two neighboring UV polygons, especially when using the Noise shader with a high Delta value. This is caused by the discrepancy between the coordinate systems of the object polygon and the mapped UV polygon. This is a general problem and can only be resolved by increasing the geometry’s resolution.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the old variation that was used automatically before version 8.2. However, keep in mind that this will lead to artifacts at the poles and in addition does not support the realignment of UVWs (especially optimal mapping).</p>

<p>Done. The texture probably covers the entire object, but now you can scale it down.</p>
<p>Select the <span class="command">Scale</span> tool, then select the <span class="command">Texture</span> Axis tool. You can drag to reduce the scale of the texture. Next, select the <span class="command">Move</span> tool and place the texture in the desired position on the object’s surface.</p>
<p>The texture is often slightly out of proportion after scaling. Select the Texture tag and, in the <span class="command">Attribute Manager</span>, set the Length values as desired. Since the length cannot exceed <span class="command_value">100%</span>, you may need to divide both values.</p>
<p>For example, if your texture is 800 x 600 pixels, you might set the lengths as follows:	 </p>

<p>Cinema 4D lets you use as many materials and Texture tags on an object as you like. Think of a suitcase with travel stickers — there is a base material (i.e. the leather of the suitcase) and many materials on top (i.e. the stickers).</p>
<p>Naturally, you will not be able to see the suitcase leather under the stickers. Also, suppose some of the stickers overlap. A sticker will, naturally, cover any stickers that it is on top of. To see one of the stickers underneath such a sticker, you would have to peel off the top stickers. Or scratch holes in them!</p>
<p>This analogy can be related closely to Cinema 4D’s behavior. Your object has a base material. You have additional materials on top of the base material. In order to see the base material, the overlying materials must be scaled down and not <a href="TTEXTURE-ID_TAGPROPERTIES.html#tile" target="">tiled</a>. You can do this by scaling down the texture geometry and at the same time disabling the Tile option. If two materials overlap and you want to see the bottom one, you must make a hole in the top one. You can do this using the <a href="MMATERIAL-ID_MATERIALGROUP_ALPHA.html" target="">alpha channel</a> or <span class="command">clip</span> mapping.</p>
<p>So how does Cinema 4D know which layer a material is on?</p>
<p>When you apply several materials, each new material is placed on top of the previous one. Thus the order of the Texture tags in the <a href="5743.html" target="">Object Manager</a> defines the order of the layers — the right-most Texture tag in the <span class="command">Object Manager</span> is the top layer, the left-most is the bottom layer. You can change the layering order simply by swapping the positions of the Texture tags using drag & drop.</p>
<p><p><div class="hint"><span class="HL_hint">Tip:<br></span>The Transparency material property does not allow the next layer to show through. Instead, use materials with alpha channels or clip mapping (genlocking).</div></p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:640px"><img  src="../pics/004584.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Figure 1.</span></div></p>
<p>For the example above, the material T1 was defined as a wall material, T2 as the poster material, which was not tiled but scaled down, and T3 for the graffiti, which was masked out using an <span class="command">Alpha</span> channel.</p>
<p>T1-T2-T3 are layered on top of each other from bottom to top.</p>
<p>Because the top-most material, T3, is masked using an <span class="command">Alpha</span> channel, the underlying materials T2 and T1 are visible. And because the texture geometry of T2 was scaled down and tiling was disabled (very important!) so it does not cover the entire object surface, part of T1 is visible.</p>
<p><a id="TEXTURETAG_MIX" name="TEXTURETAG_MIX"></a> <!--INDEX "8","Mix Textures","TEXTURETAG_MIX"--><span class="c4d_id">Mix Textures</span></p>
<p>The brick material was made using a color channel and a bump channel. The bump channel creates the illusion that the bricks have joints. Now we want to add a second bump map to the wall without changing the texture itself. How can this be done?</p>
<p>The powerful Texture tag option that makes this possible is called <span class="command">Mix Textures</span> and can be found on the tag page in the <span class="command">Attribute Manager</span>, for a selected Texture tag. By added, we mean that the material properties are added together, hence the term additive textures.</p>
<p>For example, let’s add two textures that are different colors: Red and green; the sum of the colors RGB 100,0,0 (red) and 0,100,0 (green) is 100,100,0 (yellow). If the green color has a brightness of 50%, then only 50% of the color is added. The result in this case would be 100,50,0 (orange).</p>
<p>However, the result cannot exceed the maximum color values. Adding 100,0,0 to 100,100,0 does not produce 200,100,0, but 100,100,0.</p>
<p>Some channels cannot be mixed meaningfully. For example, mixing two materials each with a refractive index of 1 would result in a material with a refractive index of 2, which is probably not what you intended. In such cases, the value of the additive (right-most) material is used (provided that the channel is active).</p>
<p><p><div class="hint"><span class="HL_hint">Tip:<br></span><ul></p>
<p><li> You can add together as many textures as you wish.</li><li> Only the following are additive: <span class="command">Color</span>, <span class="command">Transparency</span>, <span class="command">Reflectance</span>, <span class="command">Bump</span>, <span class="command">Displacement</span>, <span class="command">Luminance</span>.</li><li> Only active properties are evaluated.</li><li> An additive texture must be to the right of the texture to which it should be added in the <span class="command">Object Manager</span>.</li><li> All textures to the left of the first additive texture — up to but not including the next non-additive texture — are added.</div></li></ul><p></p>
<p><p><div class="hint"><span class="HL_hint">Tip:<br></span>You can mix multiple textures within the same Texture tag using the Layer shader or Fusion shader. These shaders include a rich variety of blending modes, making many effects possible.</div></p>
<p>Returning to the wall example.</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:640px"><img  src="../pics/004585.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Figure 2.</span></div></p>
<p>In the image above you can see the result of additively mixing the relief material T2 with the wall relief material T1.</p>
<p>In the above, you have just learned how to apply and mix multiple materials for a single surface.</p>
<p>Now we want to combine both methods, i.e., several materials will be used on an object, of which several will be added to others.</p>
<p>For our graffiti example, five materials were used. In order of importance from left (T1) to right (T5), whereby T1 (wall), T2 (poster) and T4 (graffiti) are normal materials. T3 (50% relief of T1) and T5 (100% relief of T1) are additive and T4 has an additional <span class="command">Alpha</span> channel.</p>
<p>We will unravel the mystery as viewed in the <span class="command">Object Manager</span> from left to right:</p>
<p>First, T2 is calculated additively with T3, whereby T2 is given an additional relief structure. Because T2 is not tiled, T1 is visible. T4 is calculated additively with T5, whereby T4 is also given an additional relief structure. Since T4 is masked using and <span class="command">Alpha</span> channel, T1 and T2 are visible beneath it.</p>
