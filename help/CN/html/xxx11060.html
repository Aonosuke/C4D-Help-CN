<!--NO_SEARCH_END--><!--INDEX "2","Bookmarks",""--><p><span class="HL_group">Bookmarks</span></p><p></p>
<p>You have various ways to control which items are shown in the <span class="command">Object Manager</span>: the filter settings, branch settings and search settings, as well as several viewing options on the View menu. Naturally, it would useful to be able to save these various settings as one and reuse them later. This is exactly what bookmarks are designed to do. Bookmarks save the settings in the search bar, path bar and filter (including whether the bars and filter themselves are shown) and various view settings. You can select bookmarks from the list on the Bookmarks menu.</p>
<p><p><div class="hint"><span class="HL_hint"></span>Bookmarks are saved in the scene file.</div></p>

Bookmarks help you focus on the items essential to your current task by hiding everything else.</span></div></p>
<p>Suppose you are working with a complex scene and want lights only displayed, nothing else:</p>
<p><ol><br><li> Go into the filter and switch off everything except <span class="command">Light</span> (in the Objects branch) and <span class="command">Layers</span> to hide everything in the <span class="command">Object Manager</span> except lights. Another way to show lights only is to enter text into the search bar such as <span class="command_value">Light</span>, although this only works if the lights use the same naming convention such as <span class="command_value">Light 1</span>, <span class="command_value">Light 2</span>, and so on.<br><li> Optionally, hide the filter (the bookmark also saves whether the filter itself is shown).<br><li> Create a bookmark (<span class="command">Add Bookmark</span>) and give it a meaningful name.<br></ol><p></p>

<p>Opens a window containing a list of all bookmarks in the scene. To rename a bookmark, double-click its name and enter the new name. To rearrange the bookmarks, Drag & drop them to their new positions in the list. To delete a bookmark, select it (you can also multi-select bookmarks) and press the Backspace or Delete key. To load a bookmark, Alt-click its name.</p>
<p><p><div class="hint"><span class="HL_hint"></span>You can also load bookmarks by dragging and dropping them from this window into the <span class="command">Object Manager</span>.</div></p>

<p>Makes everything visible again that was hidden by filters. Suppose you have spent days modeling and your model has disappeared. Use this command to show everything including, hopefully, the missing model.</p>
<p><p><div class="hint"><span class="HL_hint"></span>Items on hidden layers are ignored by this command. Therefore you may need to check for hidden layers as well.</div></p>

<p>Here you will find a list of all bookmarks in the scene. Click on a bookmark’s name to load it. Alternatively, Drag & drop the bookmark into the <span class="command">Object Manager</span>.</p>
