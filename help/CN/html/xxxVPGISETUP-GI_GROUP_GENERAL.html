<p>Since there are so many possible combinations of GI methods and being able to save a setup for a given Project type can really speed up worflow, this Preset option has been created, which makes it possible to save GI settings for a specific Project type.</p>
<p>In doing so, it’s important to know how your Project is set up. You should differentiate between two main types:<ul></p>
<p><li> <span class="command">Interior spaces</span> are mostly illuminated by fewer and smaller light sources: light that falls through windows and lamps that emit light within a limited radius. Interior spaces are therefore more difficult to calculate for GI.</li><li> <span class="command">Exterior spaces</span> are Projects that are basically set up under an open sky. Skies emit light evenly from a large surface, which makes it easier for GI to calculate exterior scenes.</li></ul><p></p>
<p>These presets should only serve as a starting point. These settings can then be fine-tuned to optimize render quality or render time. Additional details can be found in each option’s description. Note also the <a href="52453.html" target="">example renderings</a>, which illustrate various GI combinations.</p>
<p>You can occaisionally experiment with unusual combination of methods. Often enough you will discover combinations that work better for a given situation.</p>

<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:1200px"><img  src="../pics/037283.jpg"  ><span class="caption">The <span class="command">Primary Method</span> only brightens surfaces that are directly lit and the <span class="command">Secondary Method</span> is responsible for additionally reflected light.</span></div></p>
<p><a id="ANC" name="ANC"></a></p>
<p>GI in Cinema 4D works in two parts:<ul></p>
<p><li> The <span class="command">Primary Method</span> calculates the effect of Diffuse Depth 1, i.e., the light emitted by polygon lights or the light emitted by illuminated surfaces (via real light sources or the Physical Sky) without further reflection. In the latter case, the typical GI lighting (the red sphere that is illumintated by a white light reflects red light) with indirect reflection of light will result.</li><li> The <span class="command">Secondary Method</span> calculates the brightness of surfaces (that do not have to lie in the camera’s field of view) that are brightened by multiple light reflections.</li></ul><p></p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:1600px"><img  src="../pics/037733.jpg"  ><span class="caption">In this example, only the Primary Method was used on the left side of the picture and both Primary and Secodary methods were used on the right; on the left a polygon light, at right a normal light.</span></div></p>
<p>The results of both methods will be added to make up the overall GI when rendered.</p>
<p>Why are these methods separate? Simply because the Primary Method is most important method for the render quality and therefore higher-quality methods such as QMC or IR should be used. Of course these also take correspondingly long to render. For light that is reflected back-and-forth, methods can be used that are of "lesser quality" and render faster (such as Radiosity or Light Mapping).</p>
<p>Depending on the Project’s setup, different methods can then be combined, which practically enough already have <span class="command">Presets</span> defined for them.</p>
<p><p><div class="hint"><span class="HL_hint">Tip:<br></span>The two-part GI calculation already existed in previous versions: If <span class="command">Mode</span> was set to <span class="command_value">IR</span> and <span class="command">Sampling</span> set to <span class="command_value">Rasiosity Maps</span>, this reflected the current <nobr><span class="text_id_cycle">Irradiance Cache</span></nobr> <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_GENERAL.html#GI_SETUP_DATA_PRIMARY_METHOD" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Primary Method</span></a> and <nobr><span class="text_id_cycle">Radiosity Maps</span></nobr> <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_GENERAL.html#GI_SETUP_DATA_SECONDARY_METHOD" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Secondary Method</span></a>.

<p>Have a look at <a href="32222.html" target="">the first steps for GI rendering</a></p>
<p>In the following you will find a brief description of the individual methods.</p>
<p>Note also the rendered <a href="52453.html" target="">Examples</a>, rendered with various combinations of both methods (QMC+LM, for example stands for QMC as <span class="command">Primary Method</span> and Light Mapping as <span class="command">Secondary Method</span>).</p>

<p><span class="command_value">QMC</span> is the most precise but slowest method (also works excellently when used with Light Mapping as Secondary Method at moderate render times). Animations are flicker-free (if not free of noise) when QMC+QMC is used. Details can be found <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_GENERAL.html#qmc" target="">here (How does QMC work?)</a></p>

<p><span class="command_value">Irradiance Cache</span> is a simplified, expeditious method of ascertaining the most important areas of a given Project, calculating GI at these locations and interpolating. Animations tend to flicker if the values are too low. Details can be found <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_IC2.html" target="">here (Irradiance Cache)</a>.</p>

<p>This setting can be used to define the color saturation used within the GI calculation separately for the <span class="command">Primary Method</span> and <span class="command">Secondary Method</span> GI functions. This is especially useful if the Physical Sky produces shadows that are too blue or if the Light Mapping produces a very saturated effect. In both instances the <span class="command_value">Saturation</span> value for the <span class="command">Secondary Method</span> can be reduced. If other methods produce too little saturation (as is sometimes the case with IR/QMC as a secondary method), the <span class="command_value">Saturation</span> value can, of course, be increased.</p>
<p>Note that if the <span class="command">Primary Method</span>’s <span class="command_value">Saturation</span> setting is set to <span class="command_value">0%</span>, no colors will be available for the <span class="command">Secondary Method</span>.</p>
<p>For <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_RADIANCE.html" target="">Radiosity Maps</a>, the <span class="command">Secondary Method</span>’s Saturation will only affect real Area lights (not Polygon Lights) and/or Physical Sky (which is given a real light source via the Sun light).</p>
<p>Color saturations can also be modified for materials (see also <a href="MMATERIAL-ID_MATERIALGROUP_ILLUMINATION.html#MATERIAL_GLOBALILLUM_GENERATE_SATURATION" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Saturation</span></a>).

<p>The Diffuse Depth (that can only be defined for the <span class="command_value">Irradiance Cache</span> or <span class="command_value">QMC</span> Secondary Methods) determines how often light should be reflected from a surface (note the difference between polygon lights and real lights, as described <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_GENERAL.html#anc" target="">here</a>). Greater Diffuse Depth values will result in correspondingly, but moderately, longer render times (the difference between a value of <span class="command_value">1</span> and <span class="command_value">2</span> is greater than that between <span class="command_value">2</span> and <span class="command_value">8</span> - as you can see, a completely different behavior compared to previous GI versions) but the dispersion of light will become increasingly homogeneous, brighter and more realistic. However, the effect at values greater than 3 in a normal scene will become less and less noticeable and the rendered result will simply become brighter.</p>
<p>Note that <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_GENERAL.html#GI_SETUP_DATA_GAMMA_VALUE" target="">gamma correction</a> can, within limits, be used to compensate for lower Diffuse Depth values.</p>

<p>The visual sample emitted into the scene when a Light Map is calculated (see also <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_LIGHT_MAPPING.html" target="">Light Mapping</a>) is calculated using the number of "ricochets’ defined here. Higher values will produce a brighter and more homogenous dispersion of light with no increase in render time. The increase in brightness is less in closed spaces. In exterior scenes, the visual sample will quickly reach the sky and then be exempted from further reflections.</p>
<p>A reminder: No other GI method calculates high Diffuse Depth values as fast as Light Mapping!</p>

<p>This gamma value only affects the indirect GI lighting. Gamma values define how the internally rendered brightness values should be displayed in RGB mode. Simply stated, a progression from the darkest (black) to brightest (white) is defined.</p>
<p>This lets relatively dark renderings (e.g., resulting from a low <span class="command">Diffuse Depth</span> value) be brightened. But be careful - high gamma values will reduce contrast and "flatten" the overall image (values ranging from <span class="command_value">1</span> to <span class="command_value">3</span> have proven to be most effective; in some instances higher values may be necessary). Values less than <span class="command_value">1</span> will darken the image, whereas values greater than <span class="command_value">1</span> will brighten an image (see example above).</p>

<p>The <span class="command">Sampling</span> tab’s settings affect the GI sampling for the QMC and IR <span class="command">Primary Method</span> (if both of these are also used for the <span class="command">Secondary Method</span>, only a fraction of the value defined here will be used): How many samples should be sent and where in order to gather light from the environment?. Don’t let the numerous settings intimidate you - the first setting -<span class="command">Samples</span> - is the most important and the others are designed for fine-tuning.</p>
<p>Have a look at the image below.

<p>In the image above you can see what additional samples are created by a sample coming from the bottom left when it hits an object (samples are used to sample colors and brightness for a specific location in the environment =, gather’). As you can see, the most commotion takes place at the intersection point, Diffuse Depth 1’ and the first object (and subsequently the light reflections (Diffuse Depth 2, 3, etc.) have progressively decreasing influence on the rendered result).</p>
<p><ol><br><li> Left (<span class="command">Discrete Area Sampling</span> and <span class="command">Discrete Sky Sampling</span> disabled):<br>At the first point of contact, several samples are sent out in a hemispherical direction (this is exactly what the <span class="command">Hemispherical Sampling</span> option is meant for).<br><li> Center (<span class="command">Discrete Area Sampling</span> is enabled and <span class="command">Discrete Sky Sampling</span> is disabled):<br>In addition to the hemispherical sampling, several samples are also sent out in the direction of GI Portals / (polygonal) Area lights.<br><li> Right (<span class="command">Discrete Area Sampling</span> and <span class="command">Discrete Sky Sampling</span> enabled):<br>In addition to the hemispherical sampling and the Area light sampling, additional samples are sent out in the direction of the sky.<br></ol><p></p>
<p>The Sampling settings described below then only primarily define if and how many samples are created on Sphere 1.</p>
<p>In order to avoid too much technical jargon, take a look at the image below in which the options have been applied to a rendered Project:</p>
<p>An Area light was positioned at the rear of the room, a window in the wall on the right that looks out to a Sky object with an HDRI assigned to it (yes, it can render hard shadows!). No Cinema 4D light sources have been placed in the Project. The images were rendered in <span class="command_value">QMC</span> <span class="command">Primary Method</span> (for <span class="command">IC</span> mode, imagine spots instead of graininess for the image).</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:1800px"><img  src="../pics/036161.jpg"  ><span class="caption"></span></div></p>
<p> </p>
<p><ol><br><li> Left (<span class="command">Discrete Area Sampling</span> and <span class="command">Discrete Sky Sampling</span> disabled):<br>This is not a viable option for this particular Project. The image itself is very grainy (which is the result of random samples hitting the Area light), the shadows - if they’re even worth mentioning - are even more grainy. Bright points are also visible here and there. These are the result of very few random samples hitting the (HDRI) sky’s sun.<br><li> Center (<span class="command">Discrete Area Sampling</span> enabled and <span class="command">Discrete Sky Sampling</span> disabled):<br>The general graininess has been greatly reduced because additional samples are being sent to the Area light (each point visible to the camera is analyzed, which results in the Area light’s shadow being very defined).<br><li> Right (<span class="command">Discrete Area Sampling</span> and <span class="command">Discrete Sky Sampling</span> enabled):<br>In addition to the hemispherical sampling and the Area light samples, additional samples are sent in the direction of the sky. This abolishes the bright points because every point visible to the camera is precisely analyzed with regard to the sky’s influence (including its effect on the remaining Project elements).<br></ol><p></p>
<p>It’s not altogether wrong to leave Discrete Sampling enabled. Only for special instances in which you want to intentionally exclude one of the Sampling modes should it be disabled. The difference in render time will be noticeable if no Area light or sky are present in the Project.</p>
<p><p><div class="hint"><span class="HL_hint">Tip:<br></span>The description of the following settings applies to the <span class="command_value">QMC</span> <span class="command">Primary Method</span>.

<p>Here you will find several options from which you can choose that control the <span class="command">Accuracy</span> and <span class="command">Sample Count</span> settings.<ul></p>
<p><li> Selecting <span class="command_value">Custom Sample Count</span> lets you manually define the <span class="command">Sample Count</span> value</li><li> Selecting <span class="command_value">Custom Accuracy</span> lets you manually define the <span class="command">Accuracy</span> value</li></ul><p></p>
<p>Two methods of defining sample count are integrated:<ul></p>
<p><li> An automatic determination controlled by one of the quality settings (<span class="command_value">Low</span>, <span class="command_value">Medium</span>, <span class="command_value">High</span>, <span class="command_value">Accuracy</span>)</li><li> A fixed number of samples defined by the <span class="command">Sample Count</span> setting</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Use this setting to automatically define an optimized sample count. The optimal count depends on the Project (and in the case of the <span class="command_value">IR</span> <span class="command">Primary Method</span> on the other Irradiance Cache settings) and of course the defined <span class="command">Accuracy</span> value.</p>
<p><p><div class="hint"><span class="HL_hint">Tip:<br></span>Note that some time will be needed for evaluation, which can be optimized if you define a specific <span class="command">Sample Count</span> (if <span class="command">Samples</span> is set to <span class="command">Custom Sample Count</span>). To get a reference value for the number of samples, open the Console (main menu: Script / Console) and render the scene. Enter the value displayed for sample count that was calculated into the custom <span class="command">Sample Count</span>. Note that the GI console output can be enabled or disabled in the Preferences menu (<span class="command">Renderer</span> menu)!</div></p>

<p>This setting defines the fixed number of samples to be used. A higher value produces a correspondingly better render quality (for <span class="command_value">QMC</span> this can be seen in the graininess; for <span class="command_value">IR</span> the number of spots is reduced). Depending on the Project, values in the thousands can be entered (see also <a href="VPGISETUP-GI_GROUP_IRRADIANCE.html#qq" target="">Number of Samples Calculated Per Shading Point</a>).</p>
<p>The number of samples used for rendering will also be used by the Discrete Area and Discrete Sky Sampling if they do not have a specific number of samples defined.</p>

<p>Normally, this option should always be enabled. Disabling this option will disable the samples sent out in a hemispheric manner from the shading point (also called the, primary sampler’). Disabling this option rarely makes sense but doing so can help determine how Area lights or the sky affect the Project (because the Diffuse Depth will then be reduced to a value of <span class="command_value">1</span>). In such an instance, <span class="command">Discrete Area Sampling</span> and <span class="command">Discrete Sky Sampling</span> should be enabled.</p>

<p>This sampling method sends additional samples to (polygon) Area lights. This will, emphasize’ them disproportionally, which will have a major effect on the quality of the GI.</p>
<p>Note that the Area lights will NOT be omitted from the GI calculation if this option is disabled. These lights will merely receive no special attention and will be hit randomly by the hemispherical sampling (with a correspondingly grainy result).</p>

<p>This option is only advantageous in <span class="command_value">IR</span> Primary Method. Normally every light will be taken into consideration for the cache when an Irradiance Cache is created. However, this does not work if you have very small, bright Area lights. The result will be spotty images.

<p>The result of these calculations will not be saved in the Irradiance Cache and must therefore be calculated anew for each frame of an animation.</p>

<p>This sampling mode takes into account the sky in particular (e.g., the Physical Sky or a HDRI texture that was assigned to a Sky object).</p>
<p>A sky map will be calculated internally during rendering, which will then concentrate the additionally created samples primarily on the brightest regions during rendering. This means that HDRI textures with enough contrast can cast shadows with locally very bright regions, as in the image below.</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:1153px"><img  src="../pics/036167.jpg"  ><span class="caption">The only source of illumination here is the HDRI texture on a Sky object. Note the relatively hard shadow (option disabled at center).</span></div></p>
<p>Note that the Physical Sky’s <a href="OSKYSHADER-ID_SKY_GROUP_GENERAL.html#SKY_GENERAL_MERGE_SUN" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Merge Sky and Sun</span></a> option ensures that the Physical Sky is processed internally (incl. the effects of the sun) like an HDRI texture.</p>
<p>If this option is disabled, the sky will NOT be omitted from the GI calculation. The sky will merely receive no special attention and will be hit randomly by the hemispherical sampling (the extremely bright sun will produce a grainy image).</p>

<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:897px"><img  src="../pics/020162.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Left, rendered with QMC+QMC, right with IR+IR. Note the increased level of detail (shadows) in the QMC rendering.</span></div> </p>
<p>The QMC method of Global Illumination calculation works under a so-called "brute force" principle. This means that, for each (!) object pixel in the image, a definable number of rays ("Sample Count") can be "beamed" in a hemispherical pattern into the scene. This is not an adaptive process and the render time will definitely not be reduced.</p>
<p>This bears the advantage that it offers the most precise render results. Small details in shadows and shading can be rendered out that would otherwise not be noticeable if the IR method were used.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of using QMC as primary method:<ul></p>
<p><li> The render times are maxed out (much longer than with Irradiance Cache) and, since brightness and color values based on a finite and randomly distributed number of rays ("Sample Count") is ascertained for each pixel, the images will have a slight graininess to them that can only be compensated for by increasing the sample count, which in turn increases render time accordingly. Using <a href="32221.html" target="">Polygon Lights/GI Portals</a> (indoor scenes, primarily illuminated by light falling through windows) can noticably improve render quality (which also saves render time).</li><li> No caching takes place (as well as no pre-pass calculation). Hence, a lot of CPU power is needed (e.g., render farms) to render animations at an acceptable level of quality.  </li></ul><p></p>
