<p>We will begin by modeling the lead tip of the pencil. The tip of the pencil most closely resembles a <a href="OCONE.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_5162.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Cone</span></nobr></a> primitive <nobr><span class="menu">Create</span></nobr> menu. In the <span class="command">Attribute Manager’s</span> tab <span class="command">Object</span>, set <span class="command">Top Radius</span>to <span class="command_value">5</span>, <span class="command">Bottom Radius</span> to <span class="command_value">59</span> and <a href="OCONE-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#PRIM_CONE_HEIGHT" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Height</span></a> to <span class="command_value">250</span>. These values can be modified later if you want to create a thicker and/or longer tip. The <span class="command">Cone Object</span> is pointing upward, i.e., along the positive Y-Axis. The <span class="command">segmentation around the cone</span> is currently set to <span class="command_value">36</span> and can be increase to <span class="command_value">72</span> if a close-up rendering of the final object is later made. Since we will be trimming the bottom of the cone, increasing the <span class="command_value">Rotation Segments</span> value will result in a better-looking edge. The <span class="command">Height Segments</span> can be left at <span class="command_value">7</span> or <span class="command_value">8</span>. In order to make the tip of the pencil look more realistic, enable the <span class="command_value">Caps</span> option in the <span class="command">Caps</span> tab and set the height and radius each to 5 cm.</p>
<p><a id="hl_2" name="hl_2"></a><!--INDEX "3","The Landscape Object","hl_2"--><p><span class="HL_1">The Landscape Object</span></p>
<p>The bottom edge of the cone will be clipped to create a jagged edge. First, create a <a href="OFRACTAL.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_5169.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Landscape</span></nobr></a> object from the menu <nobr><span class="menu">Create | Object</span></nobr>. In the <span class="command">Attribute Manager</span>, activate the <a href="OFRACTAL-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#PRIM_FRACTAL_SPHERICAL" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Spherical</span></a> option to give the Landscape object a closed shape. Next, scale the <span class="command">Landscape Object</span> down so that the bottom of the cone is completely engulfed by the Landscape object (see image below). To scale the object you can activate the Scale tool in the icon palette, click and drag the object’s handles, or manually enter values into the Size fields in the <span class="command">Attribute Manager</span>. Move the <span class="command">Landscape Object</span> down along the Y-Axis, if necessary. Once the Landscape object has been placed correctly, only the tip of the cone - which will constitute our pencil lead - will peer out at the top.</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:850px"><img  src="../pics/__tut_023882.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Define the Landscape object’s parameters as pictured above.</span></div></p>
<p><a id="hl_3" name="hl_3"></a><!--INDEX "3","Unifying Objects","hl_3"--><p><span class="HL_1">Unifying Objects</span></p>
<p>Create a <a href="OCYLINDER.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_5170.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Cylinder</span></nobr></a> primitive from the <nobr><span class="menu">Create | Object</span></nobr> menu and scale it so its overall length and width is slightly longer and wider than that of the final pencil. So you can set the <a href="OCYLINDER-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#PRIM_CYLINDER_RADIUS" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Radius</span></a> value to <span class="command_value">65</span> and the <a href="OCYLINDER-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#PRIM_CYLINDER_HEIGHT" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Height</span></a> value to <span class="command_value">1800</span>. </p>
<p>Reposition the cylinder vertically so that its top end lies completely within the Landscape object. The purpose of all this is so we can fuse both objects to server as a "hull" from which a helper object will be created from the union (intersection) of these objects. Create a <a href="OBOOLE.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_1010865.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Boole</span></nobr></a> object from the <nobr><span class="menu">Create</span></nobr> menu and make the <span class="command">Cylinder Object</span> and <span class="command">Landscape Object’s</span> Child objects of this <span class="command">Boole object</span>. In the <span class="command">Attribute Manager</span>, set <a href="OBOOLE-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#BOOLEOBJECT_TYPE" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Boolean Type</span></a> to <span class="command_value">A union B</span>, which will cause both objects to be fused to a single object. All unnecessary inner surfaces will be automatically deleted. The <a href="#quality" target="_self"><span class="text_id"></span></a> option is enabled by default. To further optimize all new points of the Boolean object and, if necessary, combine polygons to N-Gons enable the <a href="OBOOLE-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#BOOLEOBJECT_SINGLE_OBJECT" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Create single object</span></a> and <a href="OBOOLE-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#BOOLEOBJECT_HIDE_NEW_EDGES" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Hide new edges</span></a> options as well (see image above). The boole object should be renamed to ensure a better overview of the objects (double-click on the name in the Object Manager). This name should reflect the object’s function, e.g., ,Negative body (additive)’.</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:567px"><img  src="../pics/__tut_024066.jpg"  ><span class="caption"></span></div></p>
<p><a id="hl_4" name="hl_4"></a><!--INDEX "3","Subtracting Objects","hl_4"--><p><span class="HL_1">Subtracting Objects</span></p>
<p>In order to make the tip of the pencil visible we must remove the <span class="command">Boole Object</span> from the cone. To do so, create a new <a href="OBOOLE.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_1010865.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Boole</span></nobr></a> object and set its Boolean Type to <span class="command_value">A subtract B</span>. The letters "A” (1st) and "B” (2nd) represent the order in which the Child objects are seen by the Boolean operator. Therefore, in order to achieve our desired result, it is important that the cone be the first Child object ("A”) and the unifying <span class="command">Boole Object</span> the second Child object ("B”) with regard to the new Boolean object. Otherwise the bottom part of the Cone object will not be removed. Rename this Boole object as well, e.g., to ,Pencil tip (subtracted)’.</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:595px"><img  src="../pics/__tut_024067.jpg"  ><span class="caption"></span></div></p>
<p>How jagged the pencil tip’s edge turns out is determined by the shape of the <span class="command">Landscape Object</span>. Use the Landscape object’s <a href="OFRACTAL-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#PRIM_FRACTAL_SEED" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Seed</span></a> parameter (Object tab) to modify the shape of the Landscape object. This can be useful if, for example, you are creating several pencils and want to avoid a homogenous look.</p>
<p><a id="hl_5" name="hl_5"></a><!--INDEX "3","Free-form deformation using the FFD object","hl_5"--><p><span class="HL_1">Free-form deformation using the FFD object</span></p>
<p>To prevent the pencil tip from looking too uniform we will apply an <a href="" target="_self"><span class="text_command"></span></a> object (<nobr><span class="menu">Create | Deformer</span></nobr>) and scale it until it is slightly larger than the tip of the Cone object. </p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:1157px"><img  src="../pics/__tut_024068.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Move the FFD object along its Y-Axis, if necessary, to center it around the tip of the cone.</span></div></p>
<p>In the <span class="command">Object Manager</span>, make the <span class="command">FFD Object</span> a Child object of the Cone object. Switch to the Use Point Tool and move the points of the FFD object around to create a non-uniform tip (see image below). In doing so, the cone’s lower edge should remain unchanged. Try to modify the tip of the cone so it looks like it has already been used to write.</p>
<p><a id="hl_6" name="hl_6"></a><!--INDEX "3","Modeling the pencil shaft using Extrude objects","hl_6"--><p><span class="HL_1">Modeling the pencil shaft using Extrude objects</span></p>
<p>We will now model the shaft of the pencil. We will do so using an <span class="command">Extrude</span> object in conjunction with an <span class="command">n-Side Spline</span> since this will let us most easily modify the hexagonal shape. We will later be able to easily adjust the number of corners, the length and even the rounding of the edges. The <span class="command">Extrude</span> object will allow us to modify the length of the shaft as well as the shape of the rounded edges at its end.</p>
<p>Create an <a href="OSPLINENSIDE.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_5179.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">n-Side</span></nobr></a> Spline object from the <nobr><span class="menu">Create</span></nobr> menu. Set its <a href="OSPLINENSIDE-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#PRIM_NSIDE_RADIUS" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Radius</span></a> to <span class="command_value">43</span> and leave the Sides parameter set to <span class="command_value">6</span>. Enable the <a href="OSPLINENSIDE-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#PRIM_NSIDE_ROUNDING" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Rounding</span></a> option and set its Radius value to <span class="command_value">5</span>. Set the <span class="command">n-Side Object’s</span> Plane to XZ. Next, create a new <a href="OEXTRUDE.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_5116.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Extrude</span></nobr></a> object and make the <span class="command">n-Side Spline</span> a Child of the new <span class="command">Extrude</span> object. In the <span class="command">Extrude</span> object’s <span class="command">Attribute Manager</span> settings, set the <a href="OEXTRUDE-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#EXTRUDEOBJECT_MOVE" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Movement</span></a> values to <span class="command_value">0</span>, <span class="command_value">2000</span> and <span class="command_value">0</span>, respectively. This will create a pencil shaft with the correct length. Move the n-Side Spline along its Y-Axis to a position as shown in the image below (make use of all viewports, if necessary).</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:811px"><img  src="../pics/__tut_024069.jpg"  ><span class="caption"></span></div></p>
<p>By moving the <span class="command">n-Side</span> object up you can later adjust the overall length of the pencil.</p>
<p><a id="hl_7" name="hl_7"></a><!--INDEX "3","Rounding Caps","hl_7"--><p><span class="HL_1">Rounding Caps</span></p>
<p>Switch to the <span class="command">Extrude</span> object: <span class="command">Caps</span> tab and set <a href="OEXTRUDE-ID_CAPSANDROUNDING.html#CAP_START" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Start</span></a> parameters to <span class="command_value">fillet cap</span>. Set each parameter’s <span class="command">Steps</span> and <span class="command">Radius</span> values to <span class="command_value">3</span>, respectively. If the <a href="OEXTRUDE-ID_CAPSANDROUNDING.html#CAP_ROUNDING" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Fillet Type</span></a> parameter is set to <span class="command_value">Convex</span>, the object’s bottom edge will be slightly rounded, this rounding (fillet) consisting of three segments. Note that a fillet automatically increases the size of the object’s profile. If you want to avoid this, the <a href="OEXTRUDE-ID_CAPSANDROUNDING.html#CAP_CONSTRAIN" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Constrain</span></a> option should be enabled. The end of the <span class="command">Extrude</span> object should be sealed with a simple cap surface without any additional filleting. When working with Boole objects it is important to know that these objects, depending on the <span class="command">Boolean Type</span> used, often only work with objects with a closed volume.</p>
<p><a id="hl_8" name="hl_8"></a><!--INDEX "3","Creating Boolean objects with Instances","hl_8"--><p><span class="HL_1">Creating Boolean objects with Instances</span></p>
<p>Next, we will trim the end of the <span class="command">Extrude</span> object just beneath the tip, thereby matching its irregular edge to that of the tip. We will do this by creating an intersection between the <span class="command">Boole Object</span> being added, the <span class="command">Landscape Object</span> and the <span class="command">Extrude</span> object. Only the <span class="command">Extrude</span> object intersection, which lies within the <span class="command">Landscape Object</span> and its fused <span class="command">Cylinder Object</span>, will remain visible.</p>
<p>In the <span class="command">Object Manager</span>, select the Boole (union) object, then select the <nobr><span class="menu">Objects| Modeling|</span></nobr> <a href="OINSTANCE.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_5126.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Instance</span></nobr></a>. This will create an Instance of the <span class="command">Boole object</span>. To make sure you created an <span class="command">Instance</span> of the correct object, simply select the object in the <span class="command">Object Manager</span> and look into its <a href="OINSTANCE-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#INSTANCEOBJECT_LINK" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Reference Object</span></a> field in the <span class="command">Attribute Manager’s</span> Object tab. If the incorrect object name is displayed in the <span class="command">Reference Object</span> field all you have to do is drag & drop the correct object into the field.</p>
<p>An Instance object can be moved and rotated independently of the reference object. It can even be scaled independently by switching to the <span class="command">Model</span> mode before doing so. When in Use Model Tool mode, an object’s points are not modified, rather its axes are lengthened or shortened. Therefore, objects that contain to editable points can also be stretched or scaled using this mode. For example, a sphere that has not been made editable can be stretched to an ellipsoid or even squashed into a disc. In our example, however, our Instance object will remain unchanged. This bears the advantage that we can, if desired, later modify the shape of the <span class="command">Landscape Object</span> and update the <span class="command">Instance Object</span> accordingly.</p>
<p><a id="hl_9" name="hl_9"></a><!--INDEX "3","Using two objects to create an intersection","hl_9"--><p><span class="HL_1">Using two objects to create an intersection</span></p>
<p>Create a new <a href="OBOOLE.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_1010865.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Boole</span></nobr></a> object with the <a href="OBOOLE-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#BOOLEOBJECT_TYPE" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Boolean Type</span></a>, <span class="command_value">A intersect B</span>. Enable the <span class="command">Create single object</span> and <span class="command">Hide new edges</span> options here to optimize the geometry. Make the <span class="command">Extrude</span> object (shaft) and <span class="command">Instance Objects</span> Child objects of this <span class="command">Boole Object</span>. Select the new <span class="command">Boole object</span> in the <span class="command">Object Manager</span> and you will see that the top part of the <span class="command">Extrude</span> object, above the <span class="command">Landscape Object</span>, was trimmed. Rename the <span class="command">Boole</span> object to ,Boole (intersect)’. To harden the <span class="command">Extrude</span> object edge, enable the <span class="command">Boole object’s</span> <a href="OBOOLE-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#BOOLEOBJECT_BREAK_CUT_EDGES" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Create Phong breaks at intersections</span></a> option. If the <span class="command">Extrude</span> object is trimmed at the bottom, the <span class="command">Cylinder</span> object in the <span class="command">Landscape</span> object’s hierarchy must be lengthened or the <span class="command">n-Side</span> object must be moved further up.</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:808px"><img  src="../pics/__tut_024070.jpg"  ><span class="caption"></span></div></p>
<p><a id="hl_10" name="hl_10"></a><!--INDEX "3","Creating a negative shape","hl_10"--><p><span class="HL_1">Creating a negative shape</span></p>
<p>What we need to do now is sharpen the tip so it looks more like the actual tip of a pencil. As you can see, only the lead tip is sticking directly out of the shaft and the tapered wood that leads to the lead tip is missing. What we will do is create this section of the shaft using the same cone that was used to create the lead tip - but how? Using the intersection between the cone and the <span class="command">Extrude</span> object would create the shape we need but would also trim off the bottom part of the pencil’s shaft. What we need is a shape that defines the part of the shape to be trimmed off. For this we will also use a <span class="command">Boole Object</span>. All we need to do is remove part of the existing cone from, for example, a simple <span class="command">Cube Object</span> in order to achieve a negative shape - basically like the shape of a pencil sharpener. Select the Cone primitive and subsequently create an <span class="text_id">Instance Object</span>. We now need to create an object from which the tip can be subtracted (to create the negative shape). The shape we will use is a simple <a href="OCUBE.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_5159.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Cube</span></nobr></a> primitive (<nobr><span class="menu">Create | Object</span></nobr>). The exact size of the Cube primitive is not that important - simply make sure that it completely engulfs the Cone Instance. Place the Cube primitive so that the Cone object’s cap surface protrudes slightly from the bottom of the Cube primitive. Subtracting the cone from the cube shape will give us the desired result (see image below).</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:936px"><img  src="../pics/__tut_024071.jpg"  ><span class="caption"></span></div></p>
<p>Create a new <span class="command">Boole object</span> (<nobr><span class="menu">Create | Modeling</span></nobr>) and use the default setting, <span class="command_value">A subtract B</span> as <a href="OBOOLE-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#BOOLEOBJECT_TYPE" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Boolean Type</span></a>. As usual, enable the options for creating a single object and hiding new edges in order to optimize the resulting geometry. In this operation, we must pay particular attention to the order in which the Child objects are placed in the hierarchy. Since the Cone Instance object must be subtracted from the cube, the Cube primitive must lie above the Cone Instance in the hierarchy (as Child objects of the new Boolean object). If you accidentally place these objects incorrectly you can simply drag & drop them into the correct order in the <span class="command">Object Manager</span>. Name the new <span class="command">Boole</span> object ,Positive body (subtracted)’.</p>
<p><a id="hl_11" name="hl_11"></a><!--INDEX "3","Completing the pencil model","hl_11"--><p><span class="HL_1">Completing the pencil model</span></p>
<p>One more step is required so the shape we just created can be subtracted from the pencil wood. You probably already guessed it - we will use a <a href="OBOOLE.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_1010865.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Boole</span></nobr></a> to do so. For this operation we will use <span class="command_value">A subtract B</span> as <span class="command">Boolean type</span>.</p>
<p>Create the new <span class="command">Boole Object</span>, this time leaving the <span class="command">Create Single Object</span> option disabled (we’ll explain why later). Make the Boole (shaft) and Boole (negative shape) Child objects of this new Boolean object - make sure the Boole (shaft) object lies above the Boole (negative shape) object in the hierarchy. What’s left is a typical tapered tip of a pencil. The pencil’s shaft remained unaffected.</p>

<p>We left the <a href="OBOOLE-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#BOOLEOBJECT_SINGLE_OBJECT" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Create single object</span></a> option disabled for the last <span class="command">Boole Object</span> we created for the following reason:</p>
<p>If two objects are fused via a Boolean operation their respective materials will be maintained on the resulting Boole object. If, for example, a red sphere is subtracted from a blue cube the result would be a blue cube with a red cavity. If on the other hand a single object is created, all parts will be combined to create that object. Only a single material can be assigned without converting the <span class="command">Boole</span> object to a <span class="command">Polygon</span> object.</p>
<p>Since we definitely want to assign the tapered wood a different material than the pencil shaft it makes sense to leave the <span class="command">Create Single Object</span> option disabled.</p>
<p>Now we can turn our attention to the application of materials. The Boole Lead Tip (subtract) object will be assigned an almost black material since it represents a lead material, and the Boole (taper) object will be assigned a wood material. The remaining part of the pencil can be textured via the <span class="command">Extrude</span> object (shaft). The image above shows what the pencil can look like when textured. </p>

<p>All pertinent parameters of our pencil model can be easily edited or even animated. The <span class="command">n-Side Object</span> defines the pencil’s profile shape and the <span class="command">Extrude</span> object defines the pencil’s length. Make sure that the bottom part of the <span class="command">Extrude</span> object  is never larger than the <span class="command">Cylinder object</span>. The shape of the tip can be adjusted using the Cone primitive and the irregular transition between the lead tip and the tapered wood section can be adjusted via the <span class="command">Landscape Object</span>. Use the Landscape object’s Seed value to vary the shape’s irregularity in case you want to create multiple pencil models for your scene. <span class="command">Landscape Object’s</span> Y <a href="OFRACTAL-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#PRIM_FRACTAL_LEN" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Size</span></a> parameter controls the amplitude of the irregular transition.

The <a href="OFRACTAL-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#PRIM_FRACTAL_SUBW" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Width Segments</span></a> value controls the number of subdivisions in the <span class="command">Landscape Object</span> and can be used to add detail if increased.</p>
