<p>抗锯齿会消除图片中的锯齿状边缘，它的原理是将每个像素分解为亚像素，比起每个像素只计算一种颜色，抗锯齿会计算多个色值然后计算均值来得到最终的像素颜色。</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:537px"><img  src="../pics/003840.jpg"  ><span class="caption">使用抗锯齿页面的设置，你可以消除锯齿状边缘。上图的右上角显示了没有抗锯齿的锯齿边缘，右下角则显示了应用抗锯齿之后的平滑效果。</span></div></p>

<p>对渲染而言，首先，渲染摄像机角度会被分解成一个像素阵列（通过编辑渲染设置菜单中的<span class="command">宽度</span>和<span class="command">高度</span>参数定义）。每个像素上都会发生很多情况，例如一个对象的边缘会穿过它，一个纹理会将像素分裂成两种不同的颜色等等，但是每个像素都只能有一个色值，考虑到要保持视觉一致性、物体和边缘的自然过渡，计算图像是一项艰巨的任务。</p>
<p>解决这些问题的一个方案是将每个像素分解为亚像素，并且为每个亚像素单独计算样本（及色值）。这个过程也被称为“超采样”（或“采样”）。</p>
<p>第二步是根据设定的像素周围半径，来统计这些亚像素的色值（通过后面描述的 filter 来实现）。</p>

<p>The image to be output will be calculated without antialiasing (any existing Render tags with differing settings will be ignored). Step-like structures will be recognizable at object and color edges.</p>
<p>This mode is particularly suited for fast test renderings for which quality does not play a role.</p>
<p><a id="RDATA_ANTIALIASING_GEOMETRY" name="RDATA_ANTIALIASING_GEOMETRY"></a><!--INDEX "10","Geometry","RDATA_ANTIALIASING_GEOMETRY"--><span class="c4d_id_cycle">Geometry</span></p>
<p>This is the default setting which smooths all object edges (automatically with 16x16 sub-pixels).</p>

<p>This enables (in addition to object smoothing) Cinema 4D’s adaptive antialiasing (additional sub-pixels will only be calculated at critical regions, i.e., for pixels whose color differs greatly from those of its neighboring pixels), which affects color edges (e.g., also shadows, objects behind transparencies, etc.). This in turn is controlled via several parameters available for this mode.</p>
<p><a id="RDATA_AAMINLEVEL" name="RDATA_AAMINLEVEL"></a> <!--INDEX "8","Min Level","RDATA_AAMINLEVEL"--><span class="c4d_id">Min Level</span><br><a id="RDATA_AAMAXLEVEL" name="RDATA_AAMAXLEVEL"></a> <!--INDEX "8","Max Level","RDATA_AAMAXLEVEL"--><span class="c4d_id">Max Level</span><br><a id="RDATA_AATHRESHOLD" name="RDATA_AATHRESHOLD"></a> <!--INDEX "8","Threshold","RDATA_AATHRESHOLD"--><span class="c4d_id">Threshold</span> <span class="range">[0..100%]</span></p>
<p>This setting is used to control Cinema 4D’s adaptive antialiasing. Sub-pixels will be calculated for neighboring pixels whose color differs too greatly; for non-critical regions (large, uniformly colored regions) no sub-pixels will be calculated if at all possible.</p>
<p>The default combination of these three parameters can be applied in most cases.</p>
<p><span class="command">Min Level</span> defines the minimum number of sub-pixels that will always be rendered. The default value of <span class="command_value">1.1</span> will suffice for most cases. If, however, artefacting should occur in very detailed regions, e.g., shadow elements get swallowed, higher values should be used.</p>
<p><span class="command">Max Level</span> is the sub-pixel dispersion that is applied to critical regions (mostly high-contrast regions, i.e., color edges or object edges behind transparencies). This value can, for example, be increased when rendering glass to ensure the rendering of finer details.</p>
<p>In the image below, the difference in render results between the two settings cannot be seen at first glance. The settings should be optimized only if you want to get the utmost out of your rendering (which will, of course, result in correspondingly longer render times):</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:1200px"><img  src="../pics/031331.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Higher antialiasing settings are often only noticeable in the finer details. In this example, the image on the right took 10 times (!) longer to render than the image on the left.</span></div></p>
<p>The <span class="command">Threshold</span> value defines the degree of color divergence at which <span class="command">Max Level</span> should be applied for a given pixel. Small values will allow no divergence, large values will allow greater contrasts before smoothing begins.</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:1278px"><img  src="../pics/031332.jpg"  ><span class="caption">Various <span class="command">Threshold</span> values at 1x1 and 16x16 for <span class="command">Min Level</span> and <span class="command">Max Level</span>, respectively. Higher contrasts are needed for higher <span class="command">Threshold</span> values for smoothing.</span></div></p>
<p>The image above shows a grayscale fan behind a glass block. Why behind a glass object? As described above, without the glass, only the object edge smoothing would take place (adaptive antialiasing only works for color edges or object edge smoothing for objects that lie behind transparent objects or in reflections). As you can see, a low <span class="command">Threshold</span> value results in all regions being smoothed because Cinema 4D will only allow minimal color divergence before it applies smoothing. The greater the Threshold value, the greater the contrast will have to be before smoothing is applied.</p>
<p>In an average scene with a Threshold (Color) value of <span class="command_value">10%</span>, about 40% of all pixels will be affected, whereas a Threshold value of <span class="command_value">5%</span> will result in 90% of all pixels being affected. A value of <span class="command_value">0%</span> will cause all pixels of a rendered image to be antialiased - including superfluous regions.</p>
<p>These three parameters have a large influence on the render speed! Settings that are too high can easily increase render times tenfold, without much noticeable difference in render quality. The default values offer very good result for most cases and moderate render times.</p>
<p><p><div class="hint"><span class="HL_hint">提示：<br></span>Note the <a href="TCOMPOSITING.html" target="">Render tag</a> in conjunction with the above.</p>
<p>This tag can be used to define antialiasing settings on object level. In the <span class="command">Edit Render Settings</span> menu, set <span class="command">Antialiasing</span> to <span class="command">Best</span> and the <span class="command_value">Min/Max Level</span> values each to <span class="command_value">1x1</span>. This reflects the least amount of antialiasing for the entire scene (i.e. none). You can, however, use Render tags to define the amount of antialiasing each object should have individually. This lets you, for example, apply a high level of antialiasing to prominent foreground objects and progressively less to objects that lie correspondingly further in the background.</div></p>
<p><p><div class="hint"><span class="HL_hint"></span>If artifacts appear (e.g., thin shadows are no longer or barely visible), either reduce the Threshold value or increase the Min Level value (the latter will save a lot of render time). If areas of high contrast are jagged — such as at shadow edges, edges behind transparent objects or within textures — increase the Max Level setting.</div></p>
<p><a id="hl_2" name="hl_2"></a><!--INDEX "3","About render speed:","hl_2"--><p><span class="HL_1">About render speed:</span></p>
<p>The render speed can be influenced by modifying the Compositing tag’s and Threshold’s (color) <span class="command">Min. Level / Max. Level</span> parameters. Using very low settings for the Threshold (color) can really bog down your computer. In an average scene a Threshold (color) value of 10% will affect about 40% of the pixels - a value of 5% will affect about 90% of the pixels. A value of 0% will result in every single pixel being antialiased in the rendering process, even where no antialiasing is necessary.</p>

<p>In certain instances it can occur that the quality of antialiasing in Multi-Passes and Alpha channels suffers. This can happen if, for example, thin structures are placed behind refractive transparent surfaces and rendered in front of a black background. In such an instance, this option should be enabled. In many cases it would be helpful to reduce the <a href="DRENDERSETTINGS-RDATA_GROUP_ANTIALIASING.html#RDATA_AATHRESHOLD" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Threshold</span></a> value. </p>

<p><a id="RDATA_AAFILTER" name="RDATA_AAFILTER"></a> <!--INDEX "8","Filter","RDATA_AAFILTER"--><span class="c4d_id">Filter</span></p>
<p>A brief explanation of how the antialiasing filter works: Depending on the antialiasing settings, a number of subpixels will be calculated per pixel whose colors are then pooled for that pixel using various functions (a pixel can only have a single color). The filter works for both <span class="command_value">Geometry</span> (object edge smoothing) and <span class="command_value">Best</span> (color edge smoothing) antialiasing types.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the filter controls how sharp and crisp the edges will be rendered.</p>
<p><a id="FILTER" name="FILTER"></a></p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:608px"><img  src="../pics/031333.jpg"  ><span class="caption"></span></div></p>
<p>In the image above are 9 edge pixels that run diagonally across the image. Take a look at the center pixel. 16 sub-pixels were used to calculate this pixel. 15 are light gray, 1 red. These pixels form a curve (Mitchell in this case). Imagine this curve as flat around the center of a pixel. This curve then defines the degree of influence each sub-pixel should have. Because the filter size (<span class="command">Filter Width</span> setting) and <span class="command">Filter Height</span> (i.e. the spread within which sub-pixels will be taken into consideration) can be expanded to up to 4 pixels, the curve can be made to spread out quite a bit more. Conversely, this means that neighboring pixels for the most part see the same sub-pixel and therefore have a very similar color. Of course edges can then no longer be made to look sharp and crisp.</p>
<p>In the following image are curves for each of the 8 different filters, accompanied by a rendered example.</p>
<p><a id="NEGATIVE" name="NEGATIVE"></a></p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:1130px"><img  src="../pics/031334.jpg"  ><span class="caption"></span></div></p>
<p>If you take a look at the curves above you will notice that several curves (Mitchell, Cubic and in particular Sinc) even fall below zero. This means that at corresponding edges, contrasting color values are rendered that are not even present in the scene. This makes the edges look sharper. This can, however, lead to problems under certain circumstances (see <span class="command">Clip Negative Component</span> option).</p>
<p>In most cases, the filter selection has little effect on the render speed.</p>
<p>It’s advisable to use a soft filter for animations. Edges that are too sharp can lead to flickering.</p>
<p><a id="RDATA_AACUSTOMFILTERSIZE" name="RDATA_AACUSTOMFILTERSIZE"></a> <!--INDEX "8","Custom Size","RDATA_AACUSTOMFILTERSIZE"--><span class="c4d_id">Custom Size</span><br><a id="RDATA_AAFILTERSIZEX" name="RDATA_AAFILTERSIZEX"></a> <!--INDEX "8","Filter Width","RDATA_AAFILTERSIZEX"--><span class="c4d_id">Filter Width</span> <span class="range">[0.5..4]</span><br><a id="RDATA_AAFILTERSIZEY" name="RDATA_AAFILTERSIZEY"></a> <!--INDEX "8","Filter Height","RDATA_AAFILTERSIZEY"--><span class="c4d_id">Filter Height</span> <span class="range">[0.5..4]</span></p>
<p>Filter Width / Height defines how many sub-pixels (calculate from the center of the pixel outwards) will be taken into consideration when the pixel color value is calculated (see also <a href="DRENDERSETTINGS-RDATA_GROUP_ANTIALIASING.html#filter" target="">here</a>).</p>
<p>As long as the <span class="command">Custom Size</span> option is enabled an ideal value for <span class="command">Filter Width</span> and <span class="command">Filter Height</span> will be used, which will also be displayed. The values are in relation to the pixel, i.e., a value of <span class="command_value">0.5</span> for both parameters means that sub-pixels 0.5 to the left and right, and 0.5 above and below the pixel center point will be taken into consideration, i.e., all sub-pixels on the pixel surface. Higher values will extend to surrounding pixels accordingly, which will result in color edges being rendered correspondingly less sharp.</p>
<p><a id="RDATA_AACLIPNEGATIVE" name="RDATA_AACLIPNEGATIVE"></a> <!--INDEX "8","Clip Negative Component","RDATA_AACLIPNEGATIVE"--><span class="c4d_id">Clip Negative Component</span></p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:579px"><img  src="../pics/031335.jpg"  ><span class="caption">A filter function’s negative regions can be clipped.</span></div> </p>
<p>As you can see here <a href="DRENDERSETTINGS-RDATA_GROUP_ANTIALIASING.html#negative" target="">here</a>, several filters (Cubic, Mitchell, Sinc) run through regions smaller than 0. If the <span class="command">Clip Negative Component</span> option is enabled, the negative regions will be clipped. What’s this good for? When using Linear Workflow, high color intensity and 32-bit rendering you may encounter problems in compositing (merging of image elements with alpha channels). Take a look at the inserts at the right of the image above: a cube was rendered to which a luminous material was assigned along with the <span class="command_value">Sinc</span> antialiasing filter. At left the <span class="command">Clip Negative Component</span> was disabled, at right it was enabled.</p>

<p>Scales the MIP/SAT strength globally. The local material settings (in which MIP Scale can also be defined) are also taken into consideration. The value range for the global settings ranges from 0% to 500%. A value of 100% represents a normal value; a value of 0% means that no MIP/SAT mapping, with regard to proximity, will take place; a value of 200%, for example, represents a doubling of the MIP/SAT mapping’s strength.</p>
<p>This value should be increased when using highly detailed textures that are directly facing the camera. This will result in a better display of continuous lines - without interruption - by the antialiasing.</p>

<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:800px"><img  src="../pics/024513.jpg"  ><span class="caption">The Raytracer renders these types of scenes much faster than the Scanliner. The marked area, for example, contains a large number of polygons per pixel.</span></div></p>
<p>Since the introduction of Render Instances it is possible to render an innumerable number of complex objects. Let’s say you have a complete house consisting of thousands of polygons located at your scene’s horizon, which is so far away from the camera that it would only be about one pixel in size when rendered. The <span class="command">Small Fragments</span> functionality is designed to render just such regions more effectively (as well as regions with high levels of Subsurface Scattering).</p>
<p>Cinema 4D has two internal render processes, the "Scanliner" and the "Raytracer", that were applied automatically without the user having a say in the matter. With regard to the aforementioned scene, the "Raytracer" will render a scene of this type much faster than the "Scanliner".</p>
<p>You might say that the Raytracer should be used to render every scene. Unfortunately this method bears the disadvantage that it delivers a lower quality antialiasing and is slower when rendering scenes of contrasting nature like the one in the image above. This is what the <nobr><span class="text_id_cycle">Hybrid</span></nobr> option is for, which combines the best of both methods. Simply put, all image regions where more than 50 polygons per pixel are visible will be rendered by the Raytracer and the Scanliner will take care of the remaining regions. The default <span class="command_value">Hybrid</span> option should therefore be the correct choice for most renderings. The <span class="command_value">Scanline Only</span> option is the render method used in pre-R11.5 versions.</p>
<p><span class="command_value">Raytrace Only</span> should only be used for scenes as the one described above. The scene will render faster than with <span class="command_value">Hybrid</span> (but the antialiasing will be of slightly lesser quality).</p>
