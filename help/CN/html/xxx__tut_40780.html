<p>Many different types of shapes can be created using curves. In Cinema 4D, Spline objects can be created by manually creating points in the Viewport or by making use of one of the many standard parametric Spline Primitives. Spline Primitives let you create anything from a simple<span class="command">Circle</span>, a <span class="command">Helix</span> or <span class="command">Text</span> with a click of the mouse. <span class="command">Spline Primitives</span> are located in the main Cinema 4D <nobr><span class="menu">Create</span></nobr> menu (as well as in the top icon palette). These shapes can then be modified via the <span class="command">Attribute Manager’s</span> settings or, if you want to work at point level, converted to <span class="command">Spline Objects</span> (i.e. made editable). To make an object editable, simply press the <span class="command">"c” key</span> on your keyboard or select the <a href="5664.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_12236.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Make Editable</span></nobr></a> command in the <nobr><span class="menu">Mesh | Conversion</span></nobr> menu. This will however cause parameters such as those used to round edges or for scaling to be lost.</p>
<p><a id="hl_2" name="hl_2"></a><!--INDEX "3","Creating Spline objects","hl_2"--><p><span class="HL_1">Creating Spline objects</span></p>
<p>After selecting the type of Spline you want to create, click in the Viewport, point-by-point, to create it. You should be in <span class="command">Use Point</span> mode and press the <nobr><span class="key">Cmd/Ctrl</span></nobr> (click and drag to create a <span class="command">Bézier</span> spline - see next section below) with the <span class="command">Move</span>, <span class="command">Scale</span> or <span class="command">Rotate</span> tool active. Creating splines manually is much easier using the new <span class="command">Spline Pen</span> and <span class="command">Spline Sketch</span> tools added in R17. These can be found in the <nobr><span class="menu">Create | Spline</span></nobr> menu.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of Spline selected, the resulting interpolation will look different, as shown in the image below. The number and position of the points in the Splines below is the same - only the interpolation between them differs. The Spline types from left to right are: <span class="command">Bezier</span>; <span class="command">B-Spline</span>; <span class="command">Akima</span>; <span class="command">Cubic</span>; <span class="command">Linear</span>.</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:537px"><img  src="../pics/__tut_024558.jpg"  ><span class="caption"></span></div></p>
<p><a id="hl_3" name="hl_3"></a><!--INDEX "3","Using Spline tangents","hl_3"--><p><span class="HL_1">Using Spline tangents</span></p>
<p>The Bézier Spline is the only curve type that can also be adjusted using tangents. Tangents can be created by either clicking and dragging with the mouse when creating the points of a curve or by selecting a point on a curve and subsequently selecting the Soft <a href="5612.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_12191.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Soft Interpolation</span></nobr></a> command (<nobr><span class="menu">Mesh | Spline</span></nobr>). Tangents of selected points can be edited by dragging their handles if the <span class="command">Move</span>, <span class="command">Scale</span> or <span class="command">Rotate</span> tools are active.</p>
<p>A tangent can also be broken by simultaneously pressing the Shift key while dragging a tangent handle. Tangents can be smoothed again or be given an equal length by using the <span class="command">Equal Tangent Length</span> or <span class="command">Equal Tangent Direction</span> commands, respectively. The above-mentioned commands can also be accessed by right-clicking in an empty area of the Viewport. The Spline object must be selected and you must be in <span class="command">Points mode</span> to do so. If no points are selected on the Spline object, the command will affect all points on the spline.</p>
<p><a id="hl_4" name="hl_4"></a><!--INDEX "3","Spline direction","hl_4"--><p><span class="HL_1">Spline direction</span></p>
<p>New points can only be added to the end of a Spline. The direction in which a Spline runs is depicted by a white-to-blue gradient on the Spline itself. The blue end denotes the end of the Spline. If you want to add points to the beginning of the Spline, the direction in which the Spline runs must first be reversed. To do so, make sure you are in <span class="command">Points mode</span> and the Spline is selected, and select the <a href="5619.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_12141.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Reverse Sequence</span></nobr></a> command (<nobr><span class="menu">Mesh | Spline</span></nobr>). <span class="command">Ctrl/Cmd + click</span> in the Viewport to add new points. If you want to add points along an existing Spline, simply <span class="command">Ctrl/Cmd + click</span> on the Spline where you want to add the new point(s). The new points’ tangents will automatically be adjusted in such a manner as to not disrupt the Spline’s original shape.</p>
<p><a id="hl_5" name="hl_5"></a><!--INDEX "3","Spline settings in the Attribute Manager","hl_5"--><p><span class="HL_1">Spline settings in the Attribute Manager</span></p>
<p>The Spline type can be changed at any time in the <span class="command">Attribute Manager</span> settings. To do so, select the curve in the <span class="command">对象管理器</span> (or in the Viewport) and select a different Spline type from the <span class="command">Attribute Manager’s</span> <a href="OSPLINE-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#SPLINEOBJECT_TYPE" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Type</span></a> menu. You will also find the <span class="command">Close Spline</span> option in this settings. Enabling this option will close the selected Spline between its beginning and end points. Since Splines remain invisible for rendering they are suited for a wide variety of uses. For example, in conjunction with <span class="command">Generator objects</span>, Spline curves can be used to define a cross-section or path. Splines can also be used in the creation of animations - to define a camera’s flight path through a structure, for example.</p>
<p><a id="hl_6" name="hl_6"></a><!--INDEX "3","Intermediate points","hl_6"--><p><span class="HL_1">Intermediate points</span></p>
<p>For calculation by Generator objects or for animations, Spline curves are divided into short, straight segments, the length of which is defined by invisible <span class="command">Intermediate Points</span> along the curve. The shorter these segments are, the more exact the curvature (e.g., of geometry created in conjunction with a Generator object). This also results in an increase of the number of points and any surfaces created. Therefore, it is wise to select a median level of accuracy in order avoid any unnecessary use of memory. There are different methods available for creating intermediate points. These methods can also be accessed in an active <span class="command">Spline Object’s</span> settings:<ul></p>
<p><li> <span class="command_value">Adaptive</span>: Analyses the curvature and adds points at locations at which the angle of curvature exceeds that of the <span class="command">Attribute Manager’s</span> <span class="command">Angle</span> value. This results in more accuracy in curves and avoids unnecessary intermediate points on straight segments. This is the most commonly used method of setting intermediate points. Top-left of image below.</li><li> <span class="command_value">Subdivided</span>: In addition to smoothing curves, makes sure the interval between straight segments is not larger than the <a href="OSPLINE-ID_OBJECTPROPERTIES.html#SPLINEOBJECT_MAXIMUMLENGTH" target="_self"><span class="text_id">Maximum Length</span></a> value. Top-right of image below.</li><li> <span class="command_value">Uniform</span>: Segments between points will be made equal to the defined <span class="command">Number</span>  value. As you can see in the example below, this can result in a slight deviance of the curvature as a result of the reduction in the level of detail. Bottom-left of image below.</li><li> <span class="command_value">Natural</span>: Functions similar to Uniform mode but concentrates its effect more in the vicinity of Spline points. Bottom-center of image below.</li><li> <span class="command_value">None</span>: Allows for no curvature at all and the Spline resembles a <span class="command">Linear Spline</span> object. Bottom-right of image below.</li></ul><p></p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:974px"><img  src="../pics/__tut_024559.jpg"  ><span class="caption"></span></div></p>
<p><a id="hl_7" name="hl_7"></a><!--INDEX "3","Making intermediate points visible","hl_7"--><p><span class="HL_1">Making intermediate points visible</span></p>
<p>In certain cases it may be necessary (or useful) to make <span class="command">Intermediate Points</span> of a Spline curve visible, e.g., when projecting a Spline curve onto a <span class="command">Polygon object</span>.</p>
<p>To do so, select the <span class="command">Spline Object</span> and subsequently select the <a href="5667.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_12233.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Current State to Object</span></nobr></a> (<nobr><span class="menu">Mesh | Spline</span></nobr> menu) command. A new Spline will be created with intermediate points as actual points along the Spline. This command can also be used on Spline Primitives that have not been made editable.</p>
<p><a id="hl_8" name="hl_8"></a><!--INDEX "3","Spline Segments","hl_8"--><p><span class="HL_1">Spline Segments</span></p>
<p>Spline curves can also consist of multiple segments, which offers a myriad of possibilities when creating objects in conjunction with <span class="command">Generator objects</span>. If, for example, a segment lies within a closed curve it will be interpreted as hole/cavity. In any case, all curve segments will be generated as separate objects. First, create a Spline Primitive or create a Spline manually. Spline Primitives must first be made editable. Next, select all Splines that you want to connect into a single Spline curve with multiple segments - can be done by <span class="command">Ctrl/Cmd + clicking</span> or dragging a selection box in the <span class="command">对象管理器</span>. Subsequently select the <a href="40756.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_16768.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Connect Objects + Delete</span></nobr></a> command (<nobr><span class="menu">Mesh | Conversion</span></nobr> menu). A new object will be created, as shown in the image below. The original Splines will remain and can be deleted, if desired. The <a href="5666.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_12144.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Connect Objects</span></nobr></a> command can also be used on multiple polygonal objects to create a single object.</p>
<p>Finally, call up the <a href="40756.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_16768.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Connect Objects + Delete</span></nobr></a> command from the <nobr><span class="menu">Mesh | Conversion</span></nobr> menu. This also works with <span class="command">Polygon</span> objects and creates a single object out of all selected objects, whereby the original Splines will be deleted. If you want to keep the Splines, select the <span class="command">Connect Objects</span> command instead (also located in the <nobr><span class="menu">Mesh | Conversion</span></nobr> menu).</p>
<p><a id="hl_9" name="hl_9"></a><!--INDEX "3","Joining segments","hl_9"--><p><span class="HL_1">Joining segments</span></p>
<p>If the Splines that were connected are not closed, these gaps can be closed using the Join Segments command (<nobr><span class="menu">Mesh | Spline</span></nobr>). This is demonstrated at the right of the image above, in which a <span class="command">Formula</span> and an <span class="command">Arc</span> Spline were made editable and joined. Simply select the two points to be joined and subsequently select the <a href="5615.html" target="_self"><nobr><img class="text_cmd_icon" src="../icons/PLUGIN_Cmd_12568.png" alt="" height="12" width="12"    border="0"><span class="text_command">Join Segment</span></nobr></a> command. A continuous spline curve will be created; if the segments previously ran in different directions they will be reversed accordingly.</p>
<p><div class="image_full" style="max-width:887px"><img  src="../pics/__tut_024560.jpg"  ><span class="caption"></span></div></p>
<p>When joining segments, note that connecting two individual Splines with different interpolation methods will result in a single Spline with a single interpolation method. The same applies to the distribution of <span class="command">Intermediate Points</span>. Hence, joining two segments can result in the shape of a Spline’s segments being altered, e.g., when a Linear Spline and a B-Spline are combined. Therefore, the best results are achieved if the Splines that are joined share a common interpolation method. The interpolation best suited for this is the <span class="command_value">Bezier</span> Spline since it can combine both soft curves and hard edges.</p>
<p><a id="hl_10" name="hl_10"></a><!--INDEX "3","Modeling with Splines and Generator objects","hl_10"--><p><span class="HL_1">Modeling with Splines and Generator objects</span></p>
<p>As already mentioned, Splines can be used in animations or in conjunction with <span class="command">Generator objects</span> to model objects. Four types of <span class="command">Generator objects</span> can be used with Splines to model objects. One thing that all of these <span class="command">Generator objects</span> have in common is that the Spline must be made a Child object of that particular <span class="command">Generator object</span>. Some <span class="command">Generator objects</span> even require more than one Spline, in which case the Splines must also be placed in the correct hierarchical order under the Generator object (more about this later). All spline-based <span class="command">Generator objects</span> offer options for closing the caps (end) surfaces, which can be applied when using closed curves or segments. Since this parameter is identical for all <span class="command">Generator objects</span> we will only describe it in detail once.</p>
